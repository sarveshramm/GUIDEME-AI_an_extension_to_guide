Placeholder Icons Required

This directory needs three PNG icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)  
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

For now, you can create simple colored square placeholders:
- Use any image editor to create solid color squares
- Or use an online tool to generate simple icons
- Recommended: Use a blue color (#4a90e2) to match the extension theme

The extension will work without these icons, but Chrome may show warnings.
You can replace these with proper icons later.
